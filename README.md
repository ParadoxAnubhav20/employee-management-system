## üìÑ Brief Summary
- Developed a **RESTful API** using **Spring Boot 3.4.5** and **MySQL** for the backend, tested endpoints with **Postman**, and integrated them into a **React 19** frontend using **Axios** for HTTP requests.
- Implements complete **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality.
- This repository contains the **backend component** of a **full-stack personal project**, designed to **store and manage employee information** using the **Spring Boot Java framework** as the primary backend web framework.
- The application enables users to **view, add, update, and delete** employee records within the management system.

## üéØ Aims and Motivation
- The primary goal of this project was to design and build a robust **Full Stack Application**, utilizing **Spring Boot** and **MySQL** for the backend, and **React** for the frontend.
- As a **Full Stack Developer**, this project serves as a hands-on demonstration of my ability to integrate modern backend and frontend technologies to create a complete and functional system.
- Motivated by a strong passion for **continuous learning and self-improvement**, I dedicated my personal time to carefully **develop, structure, and optimize** this application as part of my professional growth.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Instructions
To run this project locally, you'll need to configure the backend and frontend to communicate correctly.

### üîß Backend (`Spring Boot 3.4.5`)
1. Navigate to `src/main/resources/`.
2. Copy the example config:
   ```bash
   cp application-example.properties application.properties
   ```
3. Edit `application.properties` with your local database and server settings. Example:
   ```properties
   # Server runs on localhost:8080
   server.port=8080
   
   # Database configuration
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
   spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
   spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
   
   # JPA settings
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
   spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
   ```

### üåê Frontend (React 19 + Vite)
The frontend is served at http://localhost:5173 by default.

Make sure your frontend app is configured to send API requests to the backend URL:

Inside `vite.config.js` (or a proxy config file), add:
```javascript
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://localhost:8080',
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: false,
    }
  }
}
```

Or, inside your API calls in React (using Axios):
```javascript
axios.get('http://localhost:8080/api/employees');
```

## ‚úèÔ∏è Design ‚Äì Back-end

### üîß Back-end Technology Stack

- **Java 21** was used as the core programming language for backend development, with the **Spring Boot 3.4.5** framework facilitating the creation of RESTful APIs and overall backend structure.
- **Spring Boot** enabled the creation of **user models** to represent employee data. These models were defined using **Jakarta Persistence (JPA)** annotations such as `@Entity`, `@Id`, and `@GeneratedValue`, allowing seamless integration with the database layer.
- **MySQL Workbench** was used to manage and visualize the **MySQL database**, which stores employee information. The backend was fully configured to interact with this database, while the **React 19-based frontend** retrieved and displayed the data.
- Custom exception handling was implemented using **Spring Boot**, with tailored exceptions to gracefully handle cases such as **missing user IDs** or other backend errors.

### Postman and Testing Screenshots
- **Postman** was used as an **API platform** to **design, build, test and iterate** the **RESTful API** built using Spring Boot.
- Requests were handled in **JSON** and **SQL**.
